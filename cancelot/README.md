## Feature

This tool is intended to run on Cloud Build.
By incorporating it into the Cloud Build steps, you will be able to:

- Cancel a specific build
- Cancel build job associated with the same git branch

## Usage

```bash
Usage:
    cancelot.sh --current_build_id $BUILD_ID [--branch_name $BRANCH_NAME] [--same_trigger_only]
    --current_build_id $BUILD_ID  Current Build Id
    --branch_name $BRANCH_NAME    Trigger branch (aka head branch)
                                    (optional, defaults to current build substitutions.BRANCH_NAME)
    --region $REGION              Region (if you use CloudBuild Private Pool)
    --same_trigger_only           Only cancel builds with the same Trigger Id as current buildâ€™s trigger id
                                    (optional, defaults to false = cancel all matching branch)
```
